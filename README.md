### Abstract

CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) is a neural network-based model developed by OpenAI in 2021 that efficiently learns visual concepts from natural language supervision. This project will be utilizing this state-of-the-art deep learning model to perform interpretable observation segmentation on biodiversity image data. By making use of the captions vector distances between adjacent images, optimization on text queries and thresholds, and by modifying specifications, this project has successfully demonstrated the potential of image-caption feature on an observation segmentation task, achieving an accuracy of 92.8% on a single data folder, which is comparable to the result from image encoder alone at 93.3%. The interpretability angle of the caption to the image was also explored in this work. It is undoubtedly that observation segmentation on biodiversity image data is difficult and complex due to numerous factors which will significantly affect the performance such as the quality of the image, camera angle when taking the picture, position of the organism and the like.
